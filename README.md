# vanilla-js-weather-app
Weather App is a high-performance weather dashboard engineered to demonstrate mastery of fundamental frontend technologies without the overhead of external frameworks. Built entirely with Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+), this application interfaces with the OpenWeatherMap API to deliver real-time meteorological data.
# 🌤️ Modern Weather Dashboard

A high-performance weather application built with **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)**. This project focuses on clean code principles, efficient API integration, and modern CSS layouts without the overhead of heavy frameworks.


## 🛠️ Key Technical Features
* **Asynchronous API Communication:** Implemented using the `Fetch API` with `async/await` patterns for a smooth, non-blocking UI experience.
* **State & Configuration Management:** Decoupled sensitive configuration from business logic using a modular setup.
* **Error Handling:** Robust error management for network failures and invalid user inputs (404 handling).
* **Modern UI Architecture:** Utilized **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox** for a fully responsive design that works across all device sizes.
* **Optimization:** Zero dependencies, minimal footprint, and optimized DOM updates.

## ⚙️ Local Setup
1.  Clone the repository:
    
    git clone https://github.com/merenceleby/vanilla-js-weather-app.git

2.  Create a `config.js` file in the root directory:
    const CONFIG = {
        API_KEY: 'YOUR_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY_HERE'
    };
    
3.  Open `index.html` in your browser.

## 📝 Performance
This project demonstrates professional frontend fundamentals:
- **Clean Code:** Adherence to DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles.
- **Accessibility:** Semantic HTML usage.
- **Maintainability:** Separation of concerns between Logic (JS), Styling (CSS), and Structure (HTML).
